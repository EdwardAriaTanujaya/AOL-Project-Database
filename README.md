# AOL-Project-Database

Given file csv, we normalize it from manual system filling excel, into DBMS. 

First, we make a ERD that have been normalized into 3 NF.

Second, we filter the data from CSV, which data we can input, and which we can skip. 

Third, we make schema.sql, this sql querry is about create database, table, foreign key, referential constraint and so on. 

Fourth, we make querry.sql, this sql querry is about simulation create, select, and so on. 

Fifth, we make advanced.sql, this sql querry is about trigger and procedure.
